# Rice-Classification-and-Clustering
The goal of this project was to classify and cluster the datset containing information on tabular rice data. 
Additionally, instead of utilizing sklearn packages for PCA and LDA, I created functions that utilized matrix computations and ML mathematical concepts.
Spectral Clustering and Neural Networks will be added soon.
